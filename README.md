# SleepStudy
I set up an experiment to measure how long it takes me to fall asleep. I analyze the data using two different methods and compare the results.

This was not a school project, just something I did because I got a Google Home Mini and wanted to find a creative way to use it. 

Please see WriteUp.pdf for a description of the process and the results.
